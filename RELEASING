Releases a re made with Maven. You need the following software installed:

* Maven 3
* GPG

See http://www.apacheserver.net/Using-a-GPG-agent-for-signing-Maven-releases-on-Mac-OS-X-i30783.htm if you're on a Mac.

You also need a sonatype account and a ~/.m2/settings.xml file with your credentials. See
https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-4.MavenRepositories

Once you have this, run:

  mvn release:clean
  mvn release:prepare

When prompted for an SCM tag, do not accept the default, enter instead v0.1.0 (We use the v prefix according to semver - http://semver.org)
When prompted for gpg passphrase, use the secret passphrase we have exchanged between developers.
